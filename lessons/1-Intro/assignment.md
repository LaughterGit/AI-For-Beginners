# Game Jam

Games are an area that have been heavily influence by developments in AI and ML. In this assignment, write a short paper on a game that you like that has been influenced by the evolution of AI. It should be an old enough game to have been influenced by several types of computer processing systems. A good example is Chess or Go, but also take a look at video games like pong or Pac-Man. Write an essay that discusses the game's past, present, and AI future.

Chess, a game as complex as the number of particles in the universe, is often viewed as the ultimate test of strategic decision-making. Its significance in AI development and debate is undeniable. This essay explores AI's influence on chess's past, present, and future.
**Past:**
Alan Turing, the forefather of Artificial Intelligence, initially described how a machine could play chess in a paper. Subsequent iterations of his idea became increasingly sophisticated and successful. A pivotal moment occurred in 1997 when chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov was defeated by IBM’s Deep Blue. Deep Blue's learning process involved analysing thousands of high-level chess games and summarising them into a database. It was capable of evaluating 200 million positions per second to choose the best next move.
This event sparked controversy in and outside the chess community, with Kasparov initially accusing the engineers of cheating. However, he later acknowledged his defeat as fair.
**Present:**
Modern chess engines surpass IBM’s Deep Blue significantly, consistently beating top human players without losing a game. They leverage more data, advanced algorithms, and superior computational hardware.
Google’s DeepMind developed AlphaZero, currently the most potent AI chess engine, significantly outperforming its closest competitor, Stockfish. AlphaZero employs reinforcement learning and self-play to train its neural networks.
Stockfish, the most powerful open-source engine, allows community modifications, spawning a new era in computer science and hobbyist computing focused on developing superior chess engines.
AI has also enhanced human players' skills. By analysing their games, AI helps players improve their future strategies, revolutionising modern chess. Today's game strategies are heavily influenced by the decisions favoured by top chess engines, rather than solely relying on experience and practice.
**Future:**
Despite their prowess, current chess engines are not genuinely intelligent. They rely on extensive datasets to determine the best subsequent move. The next breakthrough in chess engines might involve Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), potentially leading to matches where two AGIs compete in a manner akin to the best or worst human players.
